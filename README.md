# Bamazon a Node.js & MySQL application

The Bamazon application is an Amazon like storefront. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

1. The customer will be presented with a table of all the items in stock.
2. The app will ask two questions:
    1. Please input the id of the product you would like to buy
    2. How many units would you like to buy
3. If there is enough items in the inventory the total for the transaction will be presented and terminate the program.

Note: The image below acts as a link to a youtube video that will display the demo. Keep in mind it will open in this page and to get back to this repo you will need to press the back button in your browser.
